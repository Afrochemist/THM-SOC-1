# Intro

 SNORT is an open-source, rule-based Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (NIDS/NIPS). It was developed and still maintained by Martin Roesch, open-source contributors, and the Cisco Talos team. 
The official description: "Snort is the foremost Open Source Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) in the world. Snort IPS uses a series of rules that help define malicious network activity and uses those rules to find packets that match against them and generate alerts for users."

# Interactive Material and VM

 Deploy the machine attached to this task; it will be visible in the split-screen view once it is ready. If you don't see a virtual machine load, click the Show Split View button.


Once the machine had fully started, you will see a folder named "Task-Exercises" on the Desktop. Each exercise has an individual folder and files; use them accordingly to the questions.

Everything you need is located under the "Task-Exercises" folder.

There are two sub-folders available;

    Config-Sample - Sample configuration and rule files. These files are provided to show what the configuration files look like. Installed Snort instance doesn't use them, so feel free to practice and modify them. Snort's original base files are located under /etc/snort folder.
    
    Exercise-Files - There are separate folders for each task. Each folder contains pcap, log and rule files ready to play with.

 Traffic Generator

The machine is offline, but there is a script (traffic-generator.sh) for you to generate traffic to your snort interface. You will use this script to trigger traffic to the snort interface. Once you run the script, it will ask you to choose the exercise type and then automatically open another terminal to show you the output of the selected action.

Note that each traffic is designed for a specific exercise. Make sure you start the snort instance and wait until to end of the script execution. Don't stop the traffic flood unless you choose the wrong exercise. 

Run the "traffic generator.sh" file by executing it as sudo. 
```            
user@ubuntu$ sudo ./traffic-generator.sh
```

# Introduction to IDS/IPS

![alt text](31b95ee3f9f1f1ab86887a011f12edcb.png)

Before diving into Snort and analysing traffic, let's have a brief overview of what an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is. It is possible to configure your network infrastructure and use both of them, but before starting to use any of them, let's learn the differences.

## Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

IDS is a passive monitoring solution for detecting possible malicious activities/patterns, abnormal incidents, and policy violations. It is responsible for generating alerts for each suspicious event. 

There are two main types of IDS systems;

    Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) - NIDS monitors the traffic flow from various areas of the network. The aim is to investigate the traffic on the entire subnet. If a signature is identified, an alert is created.
   
    Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) - HIDS monitors the traffic flow from a single endpoint device. The aim is to investigate the traffic on a particular device. If a signature is identified, an alert is created.

## Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)

IPS is an active protecting solution for preventing possible malicious activities/patterns, abnormal incidents, and policy violations. It is responsible for stopping/preventing/terminating the suspicious event as soon as the detection is performed.

 There are four main types of IPS systems;

    Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS) - NIPS monitors the traffic flow from various areas of the network. The aim is to protect the traffic on the entire subnet. If a signature is identified, the connection is terminated.
    
    Behaviour-based Intrusion Prevention System (Network Behaviour Analysis - NBA) - Behaviour-based systems monitor the traffic flow from various areas of the network. The aim is to protect the traffic on the entire subnet. If a signature is identified, the connection is terminated.

    Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS) - WIPS monitors the traffic flow from of wireless network. The aim is to protect the wireless traffic and stop possible attacks launched from there. If a signature is identified, the connection is terminated.
    
    Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) - HIPS actively protects the traffic flow from a single endpoint device. The aim is to investigate the traffic on a particular device. If a signature is identified, the connection is terminated.

Network Behaviour Analysis System works similar to NIPS. The difference between NIPS and Behaviour-based is; behaviour based systems require a training period (also known as "baselining") to learn the normal traffic and differentiate the malicious traffic and threats. This model provides more efficient results against new threats.

The system is trained to know the "normal" to detect "abnormal". The training period is crucial to avoid any false positives. In case of any security breach during the training period, the results will be highly problematic. Another critical point is to ensure that the system is well trained to recognise benign activities. 

HIPS working mechanism is similar to HIDS. The difference between them is that while HIDS creates alerts for threats, HIPS stops the threats by terminating the connection.

## Detection/Prevention Techniques

There are three main detection and prevention techniques used in IDS and IPS solutions;

## Summary

Phew! That was a long ride and lots of information. Let's summarise the overall functions of the IDS and IPS in a nutshell.

    IDS can identify threats but require user assistance to stop them.
    
    IPS can identify and block the threats with less user assistance at the detection time.

## Now let's talk about Snort.

Here is the rest of the official description of the snort;

"Snort can be deployed inline to stop these packets, as well. Snort has three primary uses: As a packet sniffer like tcpdump, as a packet logger â€” which is useful for network traffic debugging, or it can be used as a full-blown network intrusion prevention system. Snort can be downloaded and configured for personal and business use alike."

SNORT is an open-source, rule-based Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (NIDS/NIPS). It was developed and still maintained by Martin Roesch, open-source contributors, and the Cisco Talos team. 

Capabilities of Snort;

    Live traffic analysis
    Attack and probe detection
    Packet logging
    Protocol analysis
    Real-time alerting
    Modules & plugins
    Pre-processors
    Cross-platform support! (Linux & Windows)

Snort has three main use models;

    Sniffer Mode - Read IP packets and prompt them in the console application.
    
    Packet Logger Mode - Log all IP packets (inbound and outbound) that visit the network.
    
    NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System)  and NIPS (Network Intrusion Prevention System) Modes - Log/drop the packets that are deemed as malicious according to the user-defined rules.

# First Interaction with Snort

Once we use a configuration file, snort got much more power! The configuration file is an all-in-one management file of the snort. Rules, plugins, detection mechanisms, default actions and output settings are identified here. It is possible to have multiple configuration files for different purposes and cases but can only use one at runtime.

Note that every time you start the Snort, it will automatically show the default banner and initial information about your setup. You can prevent this by using the "-q" parameter.

        This parameter helps to define a specific network interface to listen/sniff. Once you have multiple interfaces, you can choose a specific interface to sniff.&nbsp;
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Let's start using each parameter and see the difference between them. Snort needs active traffic on your interface, so we need to generate traffic to see Snort in action.

To do this, use the traffic-generator script (find this in the Task-Exercise folder)
## Sniffing with parameter "-i"

Start the Snort instance in verbose mode (-v) and use the interface (-i) "eth0"; `sudo snort -v -i eth0`

In case you have only one interface, Snort uses it by default. The above example demonstrates to sniff on the interface named "eth0". Once you simulate the parameter -v, you will notice it will automatically use the "eth0" interface and prompt it. 

## Sniffing with parameter "-v"

Start the Snort instance in verbose mode (-v); sudo snort -v

Now run the traffic-generator script as sudo and start ICMP/HTTP traffic. Once the traffic is generated, snort will start showing the  packets in verbosity mode as follows; 
```
           
user@ubuntu$ sudo snort -v

```
As you can see in the given output, verbosity mode provides tcpdump like output information. Once we interrupt the sniffing with CTRL+C, it stops and summarises the sniffed packets.

## Sniffing with parameter "-d"

Start the Snort instance in dumping packet data mode (-d); `sudo snort -d`

Now run the traffic-generator script as sudo and start ICMP/HTTP traffic. Once the traffic is generated, snort will start showing the  packets in verbosity mode as follows; 
```

As you can see in the given output, packet data payload mode covers the verbose mode and provides more data.

## Sniffing with parameter "-de"

Start the Snort instance in dump (-d) and link-layer header grabbing (-e) mode; `snort -d -e`

Now run the traffic-generator script as sudo and start ICMP/HTTP traffic. Once the traffic is generated, snort will start showing the  packets in verbosity mode as follows;

# Operation Mode 2: Packet Logger Mode     

You can use Snort as a sniffer and log the sniffed packets via logger mode. You only need to use the packet logger mode parameters, and Snort does the rest to accomplish this.

Packet logger parameters are explained in the table below;

<table class="table table-bordered" style="width:1075.56px">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Parameter</b></td>
      <td><b>Description</b></td>

## Logfile Ownership

Before generating logs and investigating them, we must remember the Linux file ownership and permissions. No need to deep dive into user types and permissions. The fundamental file ownership rule; whoever creates a file becomes the owner of the corresponding file.

Snort needs superuser (root) rights to sniff the traffic, so once you run the snort with the "sudo" command, the "root" account will own the generated log files. Therefore you will need "root" rights to investigate the log files. There are two different approaches to investigate the generated log files;

    Elevation of privileges - You can elevate your privileges to examine the files. You can use the "sudo" command to execute your command as a superuser with the following command sudo command. You can also elevate the session privileges and switch to the superuser account to examine the generated log files with the following command: sudo su

    Changing the ownership of files/directories - You can also change the ownership of the file/folder to read it as your user: sudo chown username file or sudo chown username -R directory The "-R" parameter helps recursively process the files and directories.

## Logging with parameter "-l"

First, start the Snort instance in packet logger mode; `sudo snort -dev -l .`

Now start ICMP/HTTP traffic with the traffic-generator script.

Once the traffic is generated, Snort will start showing the packets and log them in the target directory. You can configure the default output directory in snort.config file. However, you can use the "-l" parameter to set a target directory. Identifying the default log directory is useful for continuous monitoring operations, and the "-l" parameter is much more useful for testing purposes.

The `-l .` part of the command creates the logs in the current directory. You will need to use this option to have the logs for each exercise in their folder.

```

Now, let's check the generated log file. Note that the log file names will be different in your case.
```
user@ubuntu$ ls .
                             
snort.log.1638459842
```
As you can see, it is a single all-in-one log file. It is a binary/tcpdump format log

## Logging with parameter "-K ASCII"

Start the Snort instance in packet logger mode; `sudo snort -dev -K ASCII`

Now run the traffic-generator script as sudo and start ICMP/HTTP traffic. Once the traffic is generated, Snort will start showing the  packets in verbosity mode as follows; 
```
user@ubuntu$ sudo snort -dev -K ASCII -l .

142.250.187.110  192.168.175.129  snort.log.1638459842
```
The logs created with "-K ASCII" parameter is entirely different. There are two folders with IP address names. Let's look into them.
```
user@ubuntu$ ls ./192.168.175.129/
                             
ICMP_ECHO  UDP:36648-53  UDP:40757-53  UDP:47404-53  UDP:50624-123
```
 Once we look closer at the created folders, we can see that the logs are in ASCII and categorised format, so it is possible to read them without using a Snort instance.

This is what it looks like in the folder view.

![alt text](d0ea7902efe8cdae918e26fa70068358.png)

 In a nutshell, ASCII mode provides multiple files in human-readable format, so it is possible to read the logs easily by using a text editor. By contrast with ASCII format, binary format is not human-readable and requires analysis using Snort or an application like tcpdump.

Let's compare the ASCII format with the binary format by opening both of them in a text editor. The difference between the binary log file and the ASCII log file is shown below. (Left side: binary format. Right side: ASCII format). 

![alt text](5e8487745a7ee4d3d33e67c2967ebaba.png)

## Reading generated logs with parameter "-r"

Start the Snort instance in packet reader mode; `sudo snort -r`
```
           
user@ubuntu$ sudo snort -r snort.log.1638459842

 "-r" parameter also allows users to filter the binary log files. You can filter the processed log to see specific packets with the "-r" parameter and Berkeley Packet Filters (BPF). 

    sudo snort -r logname.log -X
    
    sudo snort -r logname.log icmp
    
    sudo snort -r logname.log tcp
    
    sudo snort -r logname.log 'udp and port 53'
        
 The output will be the same as the above, but only packets with the chosen protocol will be shown. Additionally, you can specify the number of processes with the parameter "-n". The following command will process only the first 10 packets:

 `snort -dvr logname.log -n 10`

 Please use the following resources to understand how the BPF works and its use.

# Operation Mode 3: IDS/IPS

Capabilities of Snort are not limited to sniffing and logging the traffic. IDS/IPS mode helps you manage the traffic according to user-defined rules.

Note that (N)IDS/IPS mode depends on the rules and configuration. TASK-10 summarises the essential paths, files and variables. Also, TASK-3 covers configuration testing. Here, we need to understand the operating logic first, and then we will be going into rules in TASK-9.

## Let's run Snort in IDS/IPS Mode

NIDS mode parameters are explained in the table below;
<table class="table table-bordered" style="width:1075.56px">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Parameter</b></td>
      <td><b>Description</b></td>

Let's start using each parameter and see the difference between them. Snort needs active traffic on your interface, so we need to generate traffic to see Snort in action. To do this, use the traffic-generator script and sniff the traffic. 

Once you start running IDS/IPS mode, you need to use rules. As we mentioned earlier, we will use a pre-defined ICMP rule as an example. The defined rule will only generate alerts in any direction of ICMP packet activity. 
` alert icmp any any <> any any  (msg: "ICMP Packet Found"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)`
This rule is located in "/etc/snort/rules/local.rules".

Remember, in this module, we will focus only on the operating modes. The rules are covered in TASK9&10. Snort will create an "alert" file if the traffic flow triggers an alert. One last note; once you start running IPS/IDS mode, the sniffing and logging mode will be semi-passive. However, you can activate the functions using the parameters discussed in previous tasks. (-i, -v, -d, -e, -X, -l, -K ASCII) If you don't remember the purpose of these commands, please revisit TASK4.

## IDS/IPS mode with parameter "-c and -T"

Start the Snort instance and test the configuration file. `sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -T`  This command will check your configuration file and prompt it if there is any misconfiguratioÄ±n in your current setting. You should be familiar with this command if you covered TASK3. If you don't remember the output of this command, please revisit TASK4. 

## IDS/IPS mode with parameter "-N"

Start the Snort instance and disable logging by running the following command: `sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -N`

Now run the traffic-generator script as sudo and start ICMP/HTTP traffic. This command will disable logging mode. The rest of the other functions will still be available (if activated).

The command-line output will provide the information requested with the parameters. So, if you activate verbosity (-v) or full packet dump (-X) you will still have the output in the console, but there will be no logs in the log folder.

## IDS/IPS mode with parameter "-D"

Start the Snort instance in background mode with the following command: `sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -D`

Now run the traffic-generator script as sudo and start ICMP/HTTP traffic. Once the traffic is generated, snort will start processing the packets and accomplish the given task with additional parameters. 
```        
user@ubuntu$ sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -D

Spawning daemon child...
My daemon child 2898 lives...
Daemon parent exiting (0)
```
The command-line output will provide the information requested with the parameters. So, if you activate verbosity (-v) or full packet dump (-X) with packet logger mode (-l) you will still have the logs in the logs folder, but there will be no output in the console.

Once you start the background mode and want to check the corresponding process, you can easily use the `ps` command as shown below;       
```        
user@ubuntu$ ps -ef | grep snort

root        2898    1706  0 05:53 ?        00:00:00 snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -D
```
If you want to stop the daemon, you can easily use the `kill` command to stop the process.

`user@ubuntu$ sudo kill -9 2898`

<b>Note</b> that daemon mode is mainly used to automate the Snort. This parameter is mainly used in scripts to start the Snort service in the background. It is not recommended to use this mode unless you have a working knowledge of Snort and stable configuration.

## IDS/IPS mode with parameter "-A"

Remember that there are several alert modes available in snort;

    console: Provides fast style alerts on the console screen.
    
    cmg: Provides basic header details with payload in hex and text format.
    
    full: Full alert mode, providing all possible information about the alert.
   
    fast: Fast mode, shows the alert message, timestamp, source and destination Ä±p along with port numbers.
    
    none: Disabling alerting.

In this section, only the "console" and "cmg" parameters provide alert information in the console. It is impossible to identify the difference between the rest of the alert modes via terminal. Differences can be identified by looking at generated logs. 

At the end of this section, we will compare the "full", "fast" and "none" modes. Remember that these parameters don't provide console output, so we will continue to identify the differences through log formats.

### IDS/IPS mode with parameter "-A console"

Console mode provides fast style alerts on the console screen. Start the Snort instance in console alert mode (-A console ) with the following command `sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -A console`

Now run the traffic-generator script as sudo and start ICMP/HTTP traffic. Once the traffic is generated, snort will start generating alerts according to provided ruleset defined in the configuration file.

### IDS/IPS mode with parameter "-A cmg"

Cmg mode provides basic header details with payload in hex and text format. Start the Snort instance in cmg alert mode (-A cmg ) with the following command `sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -A cmg`

Now run the traffic-generator script as sudo and start ICMP/HTTP traffic. Once the traffic is generated, snort will start generating alerts according to provided ruleset defined in the configuration file.

Let's compare the console and cmg outputs before moving on to other alarm types. As you can see in the given outputs above,<b> `console` mode provides basic header and rule information. `cmg` mode provides full packet details along with rule information. </b>

### IDS/IPS mode with parameter "-A fast"

Fast mode provides alert messages, timestamps, and source and destination IP addresses. Remember, there is no console output in this mode. Start the Snort instance in fast alert mode (-A fast ) with the following command `sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -A fast`

Now run the traffic-generator script as sudo and start ICMP/HTTP traffic. Once the traffic is generated, snort will start generating alerts according to provided ruleset defined in the configuration file.

### IDS/IPS mode with parameter "-A full"

Full alert mode provides all possible information about the alert. Remember, there is no console output in this mode. Start the Snort instance in full alert mode (-A full ) with the following command `sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -A full`

Now run the traffic-generator script as sudo and start ICMP/HTTP traffic. Once the traffic is generated, snort will start generating alerts according to provided ruleset defined in the configuration file.  
```

Let's check the alert file (/var/log/snort/alert) ;
![alt text](cba862ab1b89fe31fe0ac1c356fde8fa.png)

 As you can see in the given picture above, full style alerts contain all possible information on the action.

### IDS/IPS mode with parameter "-A none"

Disable alerting. This mode doesn't create the alert file. However, it still logs the traffic and creates a log file in binary dump format. Remember, there is no console output in this mode. Start the Snort instance in none alert mode (-A none) with the following command `sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -A none`

Now run the traffic-generator script as sudo and start ICMP/HTTP traffic. Once the traffic is generated, snort will start generating alerts according to provided ruleset defined in the configuration file.  
```

## IDS/IPS mode: "Using rule file without configuration file"

It is possible to run the Snort only with rules without a configuration file. Running the Snort in this mode will help you test the user-created rules. However, this mode will provide less performance. 
```
user@ubuntu$ sudo snort -c /etc/snort/rules/local.rules -A console

## IPS mode and dropping packets

Snort IPS mode activated with `-Q --daq afpacket` parameters. You can also activate this mode by editing snort.conf file. However, you don't need to edit snort.conf file in the scope of this room. Review the bonus task or snort manual for further information on daq and advanced configuration settings: `-Q --daq afpacket`

Activate the Data Acquisition (DAQ) modules and use the afpacket module to use snort as an IPS: `-i eth0:eth1`

Identifying interfaces note that Snort IPS require at least two interfaces to work. Now run the traffic-generator script as sudo and start ICMP/HTTP traffic. 
```
user@ubuntu$ sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -q -Q --daq afpacket -i eth0:eth1 -A console
Running in IPS mode

```
As you can see in the picture above, Snort blocked the packets this time. We used the same rule with a different action (drop/reject). Remember, for the scope of this task; our point is the operating mode, not the rule.

# Operation Mode 4: PCAP Investigation

##  Let's investigate PCAPs with Snort

Capabilities of Snort are not limited to sniffing, logging and detecting/preventing the threats. PCAP read/investigate mode helps you work with pcap files. Once you have a pcap file and process it with Snort, you will receive default traffic statistics with alerts depending on your ruleset.

Reading a pcap without using any additional parameters we discussed before will only overview the packets and provide statistics about the file. In most cases, this is not very handy. We are investigating the pcap with Snort to benefit from the rules and speed up our investigation process by using the known patterns of threats. 

Note that we are pretty close to starting to create rules. Therefore, you need to grasp the working mechanism of the Snort, learn the discussed parameters and begin combining the parameters for different purposes.

PCAP mode parameters are explained in the table below;
<table class="table table-bordered">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Parameter</b></td>
      <td><b>Description</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td style="text-align:left">Read pcaps provided in command (space separated).</td>
    </tr>

## Investigating single PCAP with parameter "-r"

For test purposes, you can still test the default reading option with pcap by using the following command `snort -r icmp-test.pcap`

Let's investigate the pcap with our configuration file and see what will happen. `sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -q -r icmp-test.pcap -A console -n 10`

```
user@ubuntu$ sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -q -r icmp-test.pcap -A console -n 10

## Investigating multiple PCAPs with parameter "--pcap-list"

 Let's investigate multiple pcaps with our configuration file and see what will happen. `sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -q --pcap-list="icmp-test.pcap http2.pcap" -A console -n 10 `
```
user@ubuntu$ sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -q --pcap-list="icmp-test.pcap http2.pcap" -A console

12/12-12:13:29.167955  [**] [1:10000001:0] ICMP Packet found [**] [Priority: 0] {ICMP} 192.168.175.129 -> 142.250.187.110

```
Our ICMP rule got a hit! As you can see in the given output, snort identified the traffic and prompted the alerts according to our ruleset.

Here is one point to notice: we've processed two pcaps, and there are lots of alerts, so it is impossible to match the alerts with provided pcaps without snort's help. We need to separate the pcap process to identify the source of the alerts.

## Investigating multiple PCAPs with parameter "--pcap-show"

Let's investigate multiple pcaps, distinguish each one, and see what will happen. `sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -q --pcap-list="icmp-test.pcap http2.pcap" -A console --pcap-show`

```
user@ubuntu$ sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -q --pcap-list="icmp-test.pcap http2.pcap" -A console --pcap-show

# Snort Rule Structure

Understanding the Snort rule format is essential for any blue and purple teamer.  The primary structure of the snort rule is shown below;
![alt text](58234314551a2962ad5617cb22591a2b.png)

Each rule should have a type of action, protocol, source and destination IP, source and destination port and an option. Remember, Snort is in passive mode by default. So most of the time, you will use Snort as an IDS. You will need to start "inline mode" to turn on IPS mode. But before you start playing with inline mode, you should be familiar with Snort features and rules.
The Snort rule structure is easy to understand but difficult to produce. You should be familiar with rule options and related details to create efficient rules. It is recommended to practice Snort rules and option details for different use cases.

We will cover the basic rule structure in this room and help you take a step into snort rules. You can always advance your rule creation skills with different rule options by practising different use cases and studying rule option details in depth. We will focus on two actions; "alert"  for IDS mode and "reject" for IPS mode. 

Rules cannot be processed without a header. Rule options are "optional" parts. However, it is almost impossible to detect sophisticated attacks without using the rule options. 

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Action<br></td>
      <td>
        <p style="text-align:left">
          There are several actions for rules. Make sure you understand the functionality and test it before creating rules for live systems. The most common actions are listed below.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li style="text-align:left">alert: Generate an alert and log the packet.</li>
          <li style="text-align:left">log: Log the packet.</li>
          <li style="text-align:left">drop: Block and log the packet.</li>
          <li style="text-align:left">reject: Block the packet, log it and terminate the packet session.&nbsp;</li>

        <p style="text-align:left">

However, you can detect the application flows using port numbers and options. For instance, if you
          want to detect <span data-testid="glossary-term" class="glossary-term">FTP</span> traffic, you cannot use the <span data-testid="glossary-term" class="glossary-term">FTP</span> keyword in the protocol field but filter the <span data-testid="glossary-term" class="glossary-term">FTP</span> traffic by investigating <span data-testid="glossary-term" class="glossary-term">TCP</span> traffic on port 21.<br>
        </p>

### Direction

The direction operator indicates the traffic flow to be filtered by Snort. The left side of the rule shows the source, and the right side shows the destination.

    -> Source to destination flow.
    <> Bidirectional flow

Note that there is no "<-" operator in Snort.

### There are three main rule options in Snort;

    General Rule Options - Fundamental rule options for Snort. 
    
    Payload Rule Options - Rule options that help to investigate the payload data. These options are helpful to detect specific payload patterns.
   
    Non-Payload Rule Options - Rule options that focus on non-payload data. These options will help create specific patterns and identify network issues.

### General Rule Options

<table class="table table-bordered">

    <tr>
      <td>Msg</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        The message field is a basic prompt and quick identifier of the rule. Once the rule is triggered, the message filed will appear in the console or log. Usually, the message part is a one-liner
        that summarises the event.<br>

Remember, once you create a rule, it is a local rule and should be in your "local.rules" file. This file is located under "/etc/snort/rules/local.rules". A quick reminder on how to edit your local rules is shown below.

`user@ubuntu$ sudo gedit /etc/snort/rules/local.rules `

 That is your "local.rules" file. 
 ![alt text](ce53598c877a0a4c1494223d7b19f466.png)

 Note that there are some default rules activated with snort instance. These rules are deactivated to manage your rules and improve your exercise experience.

 # Snort2 Operation Logic: Points to Remember

 ##  Main Components of Snort

    Packet Decoder - Packet collector component of Snort. It collects and prepares the packets for pre-processing. 
    
    Pre-processors - A component that arranges and modifies the packets for the detection engine.
    
    Detection Engine - The primary component that process, dissect and analyse the packets by applying the rules. 
    
    Logging and Alerting - Log and alert generation component.
    
    Outputs and Plugins - Output integration modules (i.e. alerts to syslog/mysql) and additional plugin (rule management detection plugins) support is done with this component. 

##  There are three types of rules available for snort

    Community Rules - Free ruleset under the GPLv2. Publicly accessible, no need for registration.
    
    Registered Rules - Free ruleset (requires registration). This ruleset contains subscriber rules with 30 days delay.
    
    Subscriber Rules (Paid) - Paid ruleset (requires subscription). This ruleset is the main ruleset and is updated twice a week (Tuesdays and Thursdays).

You can download and read more on the rules here. https://www.snort.org/downloads

<b>Note:</b> Once you install Snort2, it automatically creates the required directories and files. However, if you want to use the community or the paid rules, you need to indicate each rule in the snort.conf file.

Since it is a long, all-in-one configuration file, editing it without causing misconfiguration is troublesome for some users. That is why Snort has several rule updating modules and integration tools. To sum up, never replace your configured Snort configuration files; you must edit your configuration files manually or update your rules with additional tools and modules to not face any fail/crash or lack of feature.

    snort.conf: Main configuration file.
    
    local.rules: User-generated rules file.

### Let's start with overviewing the main configuration file (snort.conf) 

`sudo gedit /etc/snort/snort.conf` 

### Navigate to the "Step #1: Set the network variables." section.

This section manages the scope of the detection and rule paths.

### Navigate to the "Step #2: Configure the decoder." section.

In this section, you manage the IPS mode of snort. The single-node installation model IPS model works best with "afpacket" mode. You can enable this mode and run Snort in IPS. 
<table class="table table-bordered">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><b>TAG NAME</b></td>
      <td><b>INFO</b></td>
      <td><b>EXAMPLE</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>#config <span data-testid="glossary-term" class="glossary-term">daq</span>:</b></td>
      <td><span data-testid="glossary-term" class="glossary-term">IPS</span> mode selection.</td>

Data Acquisition Modules (DAQ) are specific libraries used for packet I/O, bringing flexibility to process packets. It is possible to select DAQ type and mode for different purposes.

There are six DAQ modules available in Snort;

    Pcap: Default mode, known as Sniffer mode.
    
    Afpacket: Inline mode, known as IPS mode.
    
    Ipq: Inline mode on Linux by using Netfilter. It replaces the snort_inline patch.  
    
    Nfq: Inline mode on Linux.
    
    Ipfw: Inline on OpenBSD and FreeBSD by using divert sockets, with the pf and ipfw firewalls.
    
    Dump: Testing mode of inline and normalisation.
The most popular modes are the default (pcap) and inline/IPS (Afpacket).

### Navigate to the "Step #6: Configure output plugins" section.

This section manages the outputs of the IDS/IPS actions, such as logging and alerting format details. The default action prompts everything in the console application, so configuring this part will help you use the Snort more efficiently.  

### Navigate to the "Step #7: Customise your ruleset" section.

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><b>TAG NAME</b></td>
      <td style="text-align:center"><b>INFO</b></td>
      <td><b>EXAMPLE</b></td>

# Conclusion
In this room, we covered Snort, what it is, how it operates, and how to create and use the rules to investigate threats.

    Understanding and practising the fundamentals is crucial before creating advanced rules and using additional options.
    
    Do not create complex rules at once; try to add options step by step to notice possible syntax errors or any other problem easily.
    
    Do not reinvent the wheel; use it or modify/enhance it if there is a smooth rule.
    
    Take a backup of the configuration files before making any change.
    
    Never delete a rule that works properly. Comment it if you don't need it.
    
    Test newly created rules before migrating them to production.
